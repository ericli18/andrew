            <p>Hey! My name's Evan and I'm an 18 year old based in Chicago. My journey kicked off 3 years ago when <strong>
              I
                founded the e-learning Young Tutors
            </strong>, as a way to help elementary students prepare for and test into top
              high schools. I fell in love with entrepreneurship and betting on myself, and have since been in a journey
              of trying to learn, expose myself to new people and industries, and challenge myself to pursue the
              uncomfortable.</p>
            <p>Following Young Tutors, I did a couple of internships in business and tech, with my most recent being
              11-months as a Data Analytics intern at LinkedIn. I then entered a gap year before college, where I looked
              to network, upskill, and portfolio/project build. I did a 4-month full-time Data bootcamp and got
              certified in advanced SQL, python, Tableau, Power BI, Excel, and more. When I graduated I visited the west
              coast for 2 weeks, driving down the coast, and received personal tours to each of the big-tech company
              headquarters, allowing me to learn a ton from people with my dream jobs! Finally, I got a data engineer
              role at a Fintech startup where, as the company's first data hire, I'm responsible for defining the data
              stack and how the company will use data to drive decisions going forward.</p>
